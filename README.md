# EngineeringDescriptions
This is a repo with a synopsis of different engineering positions and their job requirements that I am making so that I can help others and myself keep up to date with the industry. 

This is obviuously not a full or comprehensive list, and things are always changing. This is meant ot be a basic list and description of what positions are available for engineers in game development, and what some of their job descriptions would be. Each one of these positions will also vary greatly depending on what studio is being considered.
